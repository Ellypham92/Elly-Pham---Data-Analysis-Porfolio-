# Elly-Pham---Data-Analysis-Porfolio-

## Introduction 
Welcome to my Github! My name is Elly. I am working as a Program Analyst at a local nonprofit in Houston, Texas. With significant exposure to Data Analytics in my profession, I wanted to explore more in depth about the Data Analytics field. I am pursuing a MS in Data Analytics program at UHD.

Here are the projects that I worked on in the past or on the progress of comletition. These projects are ones that I collaborated with my colleages, my teammates at school as well as working on independently throughout the courses of my data analytics journey. 

The tools that I am utilizing are R, Tableau, MySQL, Excel, Python and Orange.
