# Elly-Pham---Data-Analysis-Porfolio-

## Introduction 
Welcome to my Github! My name is Elly. I am working as a Program Analyst at a local nonprofit in Houston, Texas. The unique combination of logic and technology in Data Analytics is where I realized my long commitment to the field, and I am fascinated by the process of finding meaningful insights from data. 

Here are the projects that I have worked on in the past or on the progress of concluding. These projects are ones that I collaborated with my colleages, my teammates at school as well as working on independently throughout the courses of my data analytics journey. 

The tools that I am utilizing are R, Tableau, MySQL, Excel, Python and Orange.

## Project Overview

 ### 120 years of Olympic history
   #### Motivation: <br>
     The Olympic id a multi-national sporting event that attracts spectators of all ages. <br>
                 However, the game has changed substantially since its inception. <br>
                 I wanted to look at the historical data to analyze the evolution of the game and what the differences were.

   #### Tools: \Python** 

### Used cars 
   #### Motivation: According to statistics, 40.42 used automobiles were sold in 2018, while only 17.21 new cars were bought <br>
                 by the consumers. Used cars are less expensive and have less depreciation. However, unlike new cars, <br>
                 the used car selection is fairly limited. Consumers may make better decisions and receive the dream car by 
                 learning more about the secondhand car market.

     Tools: R

### Titanic data preprocessing
     Motivation: Titanic is a well-known dataset that contains information about the passengers and their chances of survival. <br>
                 The Titanic accident in 1912, resulted in the deaths of many people who were onboard the ship at the time. <br>
                 Many data scientists analyzed the dataset to create a model that can predict each passenger's survival status. <br>
                 The data is redundant and should be preprocessed in order to improve forecast accuracy.
