# Elly-Pham---Data-Analysis-Porfolio-

## Introduction 
Welcome to my Github! My name is Elly. I am working as a Program Analyst at a local nonprofit in Houston, Texas. The unique combination of logic and technology in Data Analytics is where I realized my long commitment to the field, and I am fascinated by the process of finding meaningful insights from data. 

Here are the projects that I have worked on in the past or on the progress of concluding. These projects are ones that I collaborated with my colleages, my teammates at school as well as working on independently throughout the courses of my data analytics journey. 

The tools that I am utilizing are R, Tableau, MySQL, Excel, Python and Orange.
