# Elly-Pham---Data-Analysis-Porfolio-

## Introduction 
Welcome to my Github! My name is Elly. I am working as a Program Analyst at a local nonprofit in Houston, Texas. The unique combination of logic and technology in Data Analytics is where I realized my long commitment to the field, and I am fascinated by the process of finding meaningful insights from data. 

Here are the projects that I have worked on in the past or on the progress of concluding. These projects are ones that I collaborated with my colleages, my teammates at school as well as working on independently throughout the courses of my data analytics journey. 

The tools that I am utilizing are R, Tableau, MySQL, Excel, Python and Orange.

## Project Overview

 ### 120 years of Olympic history
   **Motivation:** <span> The Olympic id a multi-national sporting event that attracts spectators of all ages. However, the game has changed                                       substantially since its inception. I wanted to look at the historical data to analyze the evolution of the game 
                          and what the differences were. <span>  <br>

   **Tools:** Python

### Used cars 
   **Motivation:** <span> According to statistics, 40.42 used automobiles were sold in 2018, while only 17.21 new cars were bought <br>
                 by the consumers. Used cars are less expensive and have less depreciation. However, unlike new cars, <br>
                 the used car selection is fairly limited. Consumers may make better decisions and receive the dream car by 
                 learning more about the secondhand car market. <span>  <br>

   **Tools:** R

### Titanic data preprocessing
  **Motivation:** <span> Titanic is a well-known dataset that contains information about the passengers and their chances of survival. <br>
                 The Titanic accident in 1912, resulted in the deaths of many people who were onboard the ship at the time. <br>
                 Many data scientists analyzed the dataset to create a model that can predict each passenger's survival status. <br>
                 The data is redundant and should be preprocessed in order to improve forecast accuracy. <span>  <br>

   **Tools:** R

### Twitter sentiment analysis
   **Motivation:** <span> A Sentiment analysis is commonly known as "opinion mining" or "emotion artificial intelligence". The purpose of this analysis                             is to determine the mood of an individual that is expressed through text toward someone or to a topic. <span>  <br>

### Predicting medical expenses
   **Motivation:** <span> Predicting medical expenses using linear regression. <span>  <br>
   **View my work book:** [TwitterSentimentAnalysis](https://github.com/Ellypham92/Data-Mining-using-R-Python/blob/main/LR-Medical-Expenses.R)  <br>
   **Tools:** R
     
### Predicting wine quality
   **Motivation:** <span> Predicting medical expenses using Regression Tree and Model Tree. <span>  <br>
   **View my work book:** [MedicalExpenses](https://github.com/Ellypham92/Data-Mining-using-R-Python/blob/main/LR-Medical-Expenses.R)  <br>
   **Tools:** R
     
    

 ### SMS spam analysis
   **Motivation:** <span> Predicting whether the text is ham or spam SMS spam analysis using Naive Bayes. <span>  <br>
   **View my work book:** [SmsSpam](https://github.com/Ellypham92/Data-Mining-using-R-Python/blob/main/SMS-spam-analysis.R)  <br>
   **Tools:** R
         
 ### Prediction of personal loan purchase 
   **Motivation:** <span>  According to Investopedia, a personal loan is an amount of money you can borrow to use for a variety of purposes. For instance, you may use a personal loan to consolidate debt, pay for home renovations, or plan a dream wedding. One of the attractions of personal loans is you can use them for practically anything. It can be offered by banks, credit unions, or online lenders. The money you borrow must be repaid over time, typically with interest. Some lenders may also charge fees. The reason I chose this topic is because of my interest in the financial sector as it is an exciting global industry with tremendous opportunities. Additionally, my interest in creating predictive models. <span>  <br>

### Implication of Covid-19 in the U.S labor market
   **Motivation:** <span> After more than a year and a half, everyone is still in shock of how much impacts that Covid has brought on to all of us. After getting hit and suffered by different COVID waves, we are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel as we are navigating through this crisis. One of the biggest issues, however, has a long road ahead to pass is the labor market. I wanted to use the analysis to provide a big picture and offer truthful insights as well as the challenges of post pandemic for U.S. labor market and the health insurance. The analysis can be used as a guiding metric for decision making. <span>  <br>
